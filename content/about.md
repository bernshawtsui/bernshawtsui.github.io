![Me](/images/about-me.jpeg)

Hi there! I’m Wenshuo, my friends call me Max. I promise, you aren’t the first to struggle with my Chinese name! 😂

{{< justify >}}
I’m based in Singapore, working as a Data Engineer for TikTok Live Data Warehouse team. My day job involves wrestling with Petabyte-scale data and figuring out how to model it in a way that doesn't just work today, but remains robust and fit for purpose for years to come.

I’m deeply curious about the "how" behind robust data architecture and data modelling. Recently, that curiosity has led me into the world of AI in Data Analytics. I’m exploring how we can use AI tools to drive insights from data more efficiently.

This site is my digital garden where I document my journey at the intersection of Data Engineering, Data Analytics, and AI.
