### Hi there! I’m Wenshuo. 
Most of my friends call me **Max**, mainly because my Chinese name is just too hard to pronounce 😂 

Max is short for **Maxwell**, which is indeed an unusual name. In China, my very first English teacher used to assign everyone a unique name in her first class with us — and that’s how I became Maxwell. It has stuck with me ever since.

### From North Korean's Border to the "Little Red Dot"
I was born in a small town ([吉林通化](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonghua)) in China, right on the border with North Korea. Although never proven, I believe my ancestors were Koreans. In fact, my family name in English is Choi, which is very Korean. At age 13, I moved to **Singapore** and began calling this "Little Red Dot" home. Later, I spent 2.5 years in **Lausanne, Switzerland**, for my Master’s degree. 

Because of this journey, I like to think of myself as a global citizen. I actively strive to be a bridge between the East and the West — a perspective I find truly unique and valuable. I believe that many of the world's conflicts and prejudices stem not from our differences, but from our **ignorance of one another**. I try my best to use my background to help bridge that gap.

### The World of Data
My career is built entirely around data. Currently, I am a **Data Engineer** on the **TikTok Live Data Warehouse** team. I’m fascinated by everything and anything about data: from building Spark clusters on k8s, to orchestrating robust data pipelines via Airflow, to designing dimensional models for petabyte-scale data warehouses. Data Engineering is an extremely diverse field, and I find it both challenging and rewarding.

### My Philosophy: No Silver Bullets
Despite "Big Data" being a buzzword for decades, I’ve noticed that few people truly grasp the **first principles** of data or appreciate the inherent trade-offs in every solution. 

In modern software engineering, there is no such thing as a "perfect" design—only the **right trade-off** for a specific use case. For instance, you can’t claim that columnar storage is *always* better than row storage; it depends entirely on the workload. 

I believe it is crucial to understand exactly what you are sacrificing and what you are gaining with every architectural choice. Through this blog, I hope to bring a bit of **common sense and sanity** back to the world of data.
