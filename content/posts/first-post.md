>"The best way to master a concept is to explain it to someone else."

<div style="text-align: justify;">

After years of working in the space of data, I decided it was time to move my notes from private scraps to a public space. For me, this blog is a creative outlet—a hobby where I can channel my thoughts and share my opinions on the many under-discussed topics in the world of data engineering.

Having worked in both large MNCs and Chinese tech company, I’ve noticed significant differences in culture, tech stacks, and general "ways of doing things." I hope to use this space to explore those differences and share what I've learned along the way.

This site is powered by Hugo and GitHub Pages—a simple, static setup that lets me focus on the content rather than the infrastructure (a nice change of pace from my day job!).
